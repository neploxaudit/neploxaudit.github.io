# Ciao

> [!NOTE]
> [ðŸŸ¢]&ensp;**WELCOME**:&emsp;`193` solves

Ciao is a **welcome** challenge released at the very beginning of the **BlazCTF**. This is a textbook example of a **sanity check** CTF task. Its description implies that participants must look closely at the given transaction to discover _a hidden treasure_.<br />

+ [ðŸ’¡]&ensp;A hint* added to the description states that participants should have a look specifically at the **calls** within the transaction, with the use of an _explorer_.

> Tony, a web3 whiz, scoured blockchain transactions for hidden treasures. His diligence struck gold when he uncovered [a lucrative transaction](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xd58271ed821a19fa5af95245e2be55782cad67f46556aa437e1af157267ce6d4) others had overlooked.<br />
> 
> *Hint: [Try Sentio Explorer and see what is called!](https://app.sentio.xyz/tx/42161/0xd58271ed821a19fa5af95245e2be55782cad67f46556aa437e1af157267ce6d4)

```solidity
print("Hello, World!")
```

<br />

## ðŸ“‘&ensp;TLDR
The transaction has input data appended to it. This data is a hexadecimal string that may be converted to text, which contains the flag.

# Bigen Layer

> [!NOTE]
> Easy | 73 solves

Bigen Layer was an easy-difficulty challenge released at the start of the CTF.
It's description didn't contain any information which would help solve the challenge,
simply mentioning the task being about a "restaking protocol" (the name and description are a reference to [Eigen Layer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/)):

> Tony Ads #1: Bigen Layer, an modern & secure restaking protocol, is designed to provide uniformed restaking entry for tokens. Dive deep into the complexities of these systems, and rememberâ€”the missing piece might just be found in unexpected places.

## TLDR

`16 ethers` worth of `ERC20` tokens are staked on a `BigenLayer` contract and
can be extorted by calling the owner-only `adminRequestWithdrawal` method using
the owner account `0x71556C38F44e17EC21F355Bd18416155000BF5a6` with a known
private key value, `0x1337`.

# Cyber Cartel

> [!NOTE]
> [ðŸŸ¢]&ensp;**EASY**:&emsp;`35` solves

<br />

Cyber Cartel was an **easy**-difficulty challenge released in the midst of the **BlazCTF**. <br/><br/> Its description introduces participants to the main ideas behind the task: it tells about the _**multisig**_ "treasury" and the _**3 guardians**_, one of whom is the _participant themself_.

<br />

> Malone, Wiz and Box recently robbed a billionaire and deposited their proceeds into a multisig treasury.
> And who is Box? The genius hacker behind everything. He's gonna rob his friends...

<br />

## ðŸ“‘&ensp;TLDR
`CartelTreasury`'s contract `doom()` method transfers all of the `TREASURY`'s money to the caller's address, but it is `guarded` by a "multisig" `BodyGuard` contract. Since `signatures` are accepted no matter the size, whilst `recoverSigner` extracts the `v` / `r` / `s` components of constant length (`32 bytes`) and  `validateSignatures` compares signatures based on their `keccak256` hashes â†’ it is possible to append "garbage" bytes to the same signature and successfully pass the multisig to call `doom()`.

# Chisel as a Service

> [!NOTE]  
> Medium | 25 solves  
> Source: https://github.com/fuzzland/blazctf-2024/tree/main/chisel-as-a-service

As mentioned in the challenge name and description, this challenge of BlazCTF 2024 exposed a usable
chisel REPL (https://book.getfoundry.sh/chisel/) instance with which the player could interact with.
Chisel itself is a tool for local debugging of Solidity snippets, meaning it wasn't really meant to be exposed to an untrusted party,
which the challenge sources tried to overcome by performing some command sanitization on the incoming input.

> Mina just develops a highly robust Solidity sandbox!

## TLDR

We are given access to the chisel Solidity REPL, but it is restricted using the `--no-vm` flag, and our input to it is filtered to disallow usage of the `!exec` command.
`--no-vm` can be bypassed by manually calculating the address of the `Vm` cheatcode contract,
at which point it can be used to set the `EDITOR` environment variable to `bash` via the `setEnv` cheatcode.
Calling the `!edit` command then opens the session REPL code in `bash`,
allowing us to use `//bin/cat` as input to the REPL, which will be interpreted as a comment in Solidity,
in order to read the contents of the flag file.

# Tony Lend

> [!NOTE]  
> Medium  
> Source: https://github.com/fuzzland/blazctf-2024/tree/main/tony-lend

The Tony Lend challenge was based on a relatively simple [curve.fi](https://curve.fi/)-based lending protocol implemented in Solidity.
`TonyLend.sol` allowed borrowing one of two assets while having these assets deposited as collateral in the protocol,
which is why the challenge initially seemed to require manipulating the `Curve` pool-based price oracle,
but in reality contained a bug which allowed to bypass the collateral check when withdrawing.
The challenge description contains nothing useful for solving it:

> Tony eats cats and dogs, and builds lending platform that competes with Trump's cryptocurrency.

## TLDR

`TonyLend`'s `withdraw` method calls `calculateHealthFactor` and checks the result **before** performing the withdrawal calculations,
allowing a user to pass the collateral check and then withdraw all of their deposited funds,
the necessary amount of which can be amassed by continuously borrowing and depositing assets.
Tony Lend 2 contained a fix of the `withdraw` bug, and required exploitation of the `Curve` StableSwap-NG Oracle vulnerability.

# Tonyallet

> [!NOTE]  
> Medium | 29 solves  
> Source: https://github.com/fuzzland/blazctf-2024/tree/main/tonyallet

Tonyallet was a classic Web2 CTF challenge released at the start of BlazCTF.
It mentioned a telegram bot in the description, and a website which can be used to
"report" specific posts to an admin bot. Usually, this means that the challenge
requires some form of browser client-side exploitation in order to leak the flag
from the Selenium/Puppeteer-based browser bot.

> Tony Ads #2 After his DeFi dreams crashed, Tony pivoted to SocialFi, crafting a buzzword-laden pitch that had VCs practically throwing money at him, all while he secretly chuckled at the irony of his newfound success.  
> Ping @tonyalletbot on Telegram! You can also report posts at https://tonyallet-us-report.ctf.so/

## TLDR

Tonyallet is a Telegram Mini App which is used by an admin bot written in Python using Selenium
to view our "posts" and then transfer ETH to the bot's own address, which is retrieved from the Mini App's web page.
Despite `DOMPurify` being used to avoid XSS attacks, we are able to create a post with a fake button covering the entire page,
performing a clickjacking attack on the admin bot, causing it to load the Mini App with our own user data instead of the bot's.

# Oh Fuck Again (One Eyed Man)

> [!NOTE]  
> Hard  
> Source: https://github.com/fuzzland/blazctf-2024/tree/main/oh-fuck-oym

"Oh Fuck Again" was the second challenge of the "Oh Fuck" duo on BlazCTF 2024. The first challenge ([blazctf-2024/oh-fuck-pendle](https://github.com/fuzzland/blazctf-2024/tree/main/oh-fuck-pendle))
was about retrieving a custom ERC20 token accidentally sent to the Pendle protocol router, which we were able to easily solve by calling the `swapTokenToToken`
method with a malicious "pendleSwap" contract. The second challenge's description hints
at a similar format:

> Tony's heart sank again as he realized he incorrectly sent millions of dollars again. He was hacking arbitrage bots and came across a bot named One Eyed Man (https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf9997ff3178ee54270735fdc00d4a26730787e0). He felt he can trick the bot by sending fake tokens to it but accidentally sent real money. Help Tony recover his money.

## TLDR

The bot's contract contains a fallback function with callback-like payment mechanisms for non-EOA callers.
By executing this mechanism in a carefully-crafted call from our own contract,
we can get the bot to transfer arbitrary tokens to us by returning the desired token
address from the `token0()` method of our contract.

# solalloc

> [!NOTE]  
> Hard | 16 solves  
> Source: https://github.com/fuzzland/blazctf-2024/tree/main/solalloc

solalloc was a Solana-based challenge developed using OtterSec's [sol-ctf-framework](https://github.com/otter-sec/sol-ctf-framework)
with the smart contracts, or "programs" as they are called in Solana,
being written in C with the use of Solana's official SDK.
As it is hinted in the challenge description and category (PWN),
the challenge's solution required exploitation of buggy manual memory management:

> Tony, chasing the Solana hype, hastily ported his Ethereum contracts, playing fast and loose with Solana's memory allocations. As chaos ensued, Tony realized his overconfidence might cost him dearly. Help Tony unravel the mess he's made.

## TLDR

`solalloc` implements a Solana program using the C language and SDK,
and uses a custom allocator to manage memory on the "heap" address space.
The custom `BlazAllocator` allows overflowing the free memory pointer
by passing a large size value to the `malloc` implementation,
which can be utilized to overwrite the `caller_key` stack variable in order
to impersonate the admin and drain funds from the challenge's balance.
